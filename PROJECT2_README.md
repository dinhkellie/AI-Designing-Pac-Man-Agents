1. Table of DFS and BFS Evaluation 
Assumption: being optimal means the algorithm finds the best solution/shortest route

2. Reflection on how the searches compare 
Based on the data in the table above, Depth-First Search always finds a solution, but the solution is not guaranteed to be optimal. It explores relatively fewer nodes than Breath-First Search. Breath-First Search explore always finds a solution, and the solution is guaranteed to be optimal. However, it also explores more nodes than Depth-First Search.

Based on the algorithms, I think whether Depth-First Search finds an optimal solution or not is dependent on the number of nodes in between the starting point and destination.
