1. Describe behavior of RandomAgent
  * tinyMaze: The agent chooses one random action from an array of available actions. The game runs until the agent eats the capsule. The agent moves randomly and quickly and has continuous movements. In the tinyMaze environment, the agent completed the game relatively quickly compared to the mediumMaze due to the less amount of walls. It eventually will always get the food but the time it will take is not predetermined. 
  * mediumMaze: We used the openSearch layout and the agent was also moving randomly and quickly, but does not look for the food. It took a longer time, more steps, and had a lower score. When the agent finds food, it does not continue in that direction and just moves randomly, oftentimes moving in circles in a blank section of the environment without any food.
